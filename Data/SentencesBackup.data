Let all who fear the Lord repeat his faithful love endures forever
In my distress I prayed to the Lord and the Lord answered me and set me free
The Lord is for me so I will have no fear What can mere people do to me?
Yes the Lord is for me he will help me I will look in triumph over those who hate me
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in people
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes
Though hostile nations surrounded me I destroyed them all with the authority of the Lord
